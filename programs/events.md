# Community Events

We sponsor, host, and promote events and activities that educate and help connect people in the industry. Our goal is to gather professional or aspiring devs together to chat, learn from each other, and build out stronger networks. 

<h2 class="mt-4">Our Groups and Events</h2>

A variety of CNY tech events and groups fall under the CODES umbrella. 

**Open Hack**: A monthly casual social coding meetup with a simple purpose: Code together, on anything. Open Hack has been happening monthly for over 6 years and counting.

**SyracuseJS**: A group dedicated to discussing and working with the JavaScript programming language. For experienced programmers and those just getting started, all are welcome. 

**Women In Coding**: Local women developers host a monthly meetup, focused on a different language or topic each month. Although this group is geared towards women, anyone is welcome to attend classes.

Event organizers in the community also host a variety of other networking and educational events, like Coffee and Code meetups, Happy Hours, Panel Discussions, and more.
